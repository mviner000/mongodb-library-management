I've implemented the requested changes to add the max_used column to all collections that had the pinned_by field. Here's what I've done:

Created a new get_max_used_properties() function in mongodb_schema.rs that returns a Document with the max_used field configuration.
Updated the merge_with_archive_and_pinned_properties() function to include the max_used property in addition to the archive and pinned properties.
